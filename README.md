# GoRest API Testing Project
# This project demonstrates CRUD operations on the GoRest API using Python, requests, and Pytest. It includes functions to fetch, insert, update, and delete user data, along with test cases for each operation. The project showcases my understanding of API testing, handling status codes, and working with JSON data.
